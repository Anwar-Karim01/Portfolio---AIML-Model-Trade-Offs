## üîç Artifact 2: Pre-Trained Model Decision Matrix

**Customization for the Audience:**  
The matrix was designed to enable students, data scientists, and educators easily evaluate trade-offs between model size, speed, and accuracy.  The graphic display makes it easier to explain AI selection to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Lessons Learned:**  
This experiment gave me a better understanding of how domain-specific needs influence model choice.  For example, vision models prefer lightweight architecture for edge deployment, yet NLP models frequently need high memory footprints for contextual richness.

**Feedback and Revisions:**  
Based on peer input, I clarified the matrix, ensured that all measurements were acknowledged from benchmark sources, and included a PNG version for visual learners.

**Personal Growth:**  
The project helped me improve my comparative analytical and communication abilities, which are critical for presenting AI solutions in collaborative situations.
